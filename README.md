# BoundingBoxGeneratorExtension
A Chrome Extension designed to let you create bounding boxes over any images in a Google Search. Press "Ctrl+B" to activate bounding box mode, then draw bounding boxes and press "Ctrl+B" again to save both the image and the XML annotation. If you're unsatisfied with the bounding box you've drawn, you can cancel the save by pressing "Ctrl+X". See a video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA3DwSzuxas.
